                    C-Space offers access to a Makerbot Digitizer Desktop Makerbot Replicator 5th Generation 3D printer.  This equipment may be used by all currently enrolled WSU students or employees of Wichita State.  The scanner may be used to scan and create a digital file of three-dimensional objects.  The printer uses PLA plastic filament to print three-dimensional objects  using a design that is uploaded from a digital computer file
